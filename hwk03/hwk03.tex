\item[Bayesian belief networks for adaptive management] Hans Jørgen Henriksen and Heidi Christiansen Barlebo cite that
Bayesian networks (BNs) are often helpful in highly complex problems where "there is a scarcity and uncertainty in the
data used in making the decision and the factors are interlinked" (1026).  BNs allow stakeholders to work out with
experts what causal links exist in a system in order to better develop models for possible outcomes.  In their work
with pesticide reduction instruments\----contracts with farmers\----and their impact on groundwater safety, the authors
found that "rather costly compensations" would be required to ensure a 95\% probability that the water resources would
remain safe (1029).  When a special uncertainty arose where stakeholders disagreed, an additional "perception of
vulnerability" state was added to address this disagreement rather than favor one group over another (1029).  In their
follow-up, the authors found that two water managers involved in the process thought that BNs provided an alternative to
standard welfare economics, as BNs "could help to delineate the complexities and also handle some of the uncertainties"
associated with water management (1031).
